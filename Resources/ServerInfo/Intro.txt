Welcome to the Dragon's Den! You've just arrived aboard the Frontier outpost and together with the rest of the crew, you must cooperate, perform your duties to the best of your ability, and have fun (hopefully not at the expense of others).

Please make sure you understand the server rules (F10>Rules) and if you have any questions, consult with guide(NUM0), your colleagues on shift in person or over radio or via discord. You can also ask admins for help (F1) find any admin and typing a message to any online admins. Especially do this if you witness someone breaking rules.

To reiterate, you are all a crew of people who work together (even the clown) and you should not be harming each other unless you have an extremely good reason (self-defense) and even then, call security over radio, stun and detain, do not commit murder as a non antagonist (see antagonist further down).

Instead of intents, we have combat mode. Check controls below for its keybind. You can't attack anybody with it off, so no more hitting yourself with your own crowbar.
